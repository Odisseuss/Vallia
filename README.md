## Folder Structure:

### Components Folder

Contains standalone custom components, like Buttons, Forms, Progress Bars and others. These can be imported in any file, and configured by passing them props. Each component has been configured to accept different props that will change the styling, or content of the component. There are comments included in every component file informing you of how you can use or extend the components to suit your needs.
If you use an IDE such as Visual Studio Code, when writing props for a component, you can press Ctrl+Space to trigger intellisense and see what props are available for that specific component.

### Layout_presets Folder

This folder contains some already made website "sections" that are made up of multiple smaller components. You can edit their source code in order to personalize them if you want.
